Misc source release notes.

There's too much here to write an adequete source description in the time
that I have, so I'm not even going to try.

Some of the routines in VGA.C might look really non-practical, but they
are faster than the more obvious ways of going about it. They could still
be optimized even more, but there's not really any point in doing that.

I use a modified version of MikMod 2.09. You shouldn't need to modify mikmod.a
but if you do the source to the version I use is in mikmod.zip.

There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. Live with it. Or better
yet, fix it. Just do NOT complain to me about it.
